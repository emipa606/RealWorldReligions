  <description>This is an addon to the Religions of Rimworld mod created by Castor (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1645324706). It hopes to add at least the top most popular religions in our real world.
	It is a WIP and so far only Christianism has been added. More will be added in the future.
